# How to contribute

You are very welcome to contribute to `raddo` and we would love to see your ideas.

Wether you want to make changes, allowing the software to work in your environment or to extend the functionality of it, it should be straightforward and as easy as possible.
The few guidelines which need to be followed by the contributor are listed below.
To keep it simple we follow the 'standard procedure' on github.

## Introduction to `git` and `Github`
Resources for learning git:

- [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- Further [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/)


## General Information on pull requests

*from https://opensource.guide*:

> You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:
>
>  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
>  - Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in an issue
>

Tips and guidelines:

- sync your fork ([guide](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
)) often with the upstream repository to avoid merge conflicts.
- adhere to the GitHub Flow and create a meaningful branch for your changes
- reference relevant issues in your pull request (e.g. 'Closes #21.')


## Contributing to Issues

You can contribute either by helping to solve existing issues and provide the code updates via pull request or by filing new issues.

*from https://opensource.guide*:

>  You should usually open an issue in the following situations:
>
>   - Report an error you can’t solve yourself
>   - Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)
>   - Propose a new feature or other project idea

In any case:

* Check if the issue you are going to file already exists in our [open issues]() .
* If you can't find your issue already, [open a new one]().

## Contributing to Code

New features and bug fixes are very welcome. But, pull requests can only be accepted if:

* all continuous integration builds pass and
* tests for new code sections are included.


## Contributing to Documentation

Contributions to the documentation of the software are always welcome.

After forking the repo, please find the documentation files inside the `/doc` folder in the root path of the repository. Adjust and file a pull request like you would do with code updates.
